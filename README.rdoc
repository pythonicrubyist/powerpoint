    @deck.add_intro title, subtitle
    
    # Creating a text-only slide:
    # Title must be a string.
    # Content must be an array of strings that will be displayed as bullet items.
    title = 'Why Mac?'
    content = ['Its cool!', 'Its light.']
    @deck.add_textual_slide title, content

    # Creating an image-only slide:
    # It will contain a title as string.
    # and an embedded image
    title = 'Everyone loves Macs:'
    image_path = 'samples/images/sample_gif.gif'
    @deck.add_pictorial_slide title, image_path
    
    # Specifying coordinates and image size for an embeded image.
    # x and y values define the position of the image on the slide.
    # cx and cy define the width and height of the image.
    # x, y, cx, cy are in points. Each pixel is 12700 points.
    # coordinates parameter is optional.
    coords = {x: 124200, y: 3356451, cx: 2895600, cy: 1013460}
    @deck.add_pictorial_slide title, image_path, coords

    # Creating an image with text slide:
    # It will contain a title as string and
    # an embedded image with additional content as text.
    # The text can be introduced as a String, Array or Hash, and has
    # differents formats at the slide.
    # Both can also specify coordinates.
    title = 'Picture with content'
    image_path = 'samples/images/sample_png.png'
